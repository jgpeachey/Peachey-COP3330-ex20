/*
Create a tax calculator that handles multiple states and multiple counties
within each state. The program prompts the user for the order amount and the
state where the order will be shipped.

*Wisconsin residents must be changed 5% sales tax with an additional
county-level charge. For Wisconsin residents, prompt for the county of
residence.
*For Eau Claire county residents, add an additional 0.005 tax.
*For Dunn county residents, add an additional 0.004 tax.
*Illinois residents must be charged 8% sales tax with no additional
county-level charge.
*All other states are not charged tax.
*The program then displays the tax and the total for Wisconsin and Illinois
residents but just the total for everyone else.

Example Output:
What is the order amount? 10
What state do you live in? Wisconsin
What county do you live in? Dane
The tax is $0.50.
The total is $10.50.

Constraints:
*Ensure that all money is rounded up to the nearest cent.
*Use a single output statement at the end of the program to display the
program results.

Challenges:
*Add support for your state and county.
*Allow the user to enter a state abbreviation and county name in upper,
lower, or mixed case.
*Allow the user to also enter the stateâ€™s full name in upper, lower, or
mixed case.
*Implement the program using data structures to avoid nested if statements.
